**Principles of SwiftlyCrypto**: 

- Every public class, structure, method, or function requires documentation.
- Every class, structure, method, or function needs to have explicitly declared accessibility (including `internal`).
  - This will give developers a clearer idea of the accessibility of source code definitions.
- Before initiate a pull request, make sure the code has been tested and is working as expected.
  - Make sure that the test code remains in Tests
- When defining a type, separate the type definition, methods, and functions into different extensions.
---
**Developers can extend methods by their own, if you think your method is critical, please opensource it to this project!**
